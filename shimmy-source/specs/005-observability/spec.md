# Feature 005 â€” Advanced Observability & Self-Optimization

## Intent
Provide comprehensive observability, metrics collection, and self-optimization capabilities that enable users to understand Shimmy's performance, troubleshoot issues, and automatically optimize configuration for their specific workloads.

## Problem Statement
Current Shimmy deployments lack visibility into:
- Performance characteristics and bottlenecks
- Resource utilization patterns
- Model usage analytics
- System health and optimization opportunities
- Predictive insights for capacity planning

Production users need observability to ensure reliability, optimize performance, and plan for growth.

## User Stories

### As a Production Operator
- I want detailed metrics on model performance so that I can identify bottlenecks and optimization opportunities
- I want alerts when system performance degrades so that I can respond proactively
- I want capacity planning insights so that I can scale my deployment appropriately
- I want integration with monitoring tools (Prometheus, Grafana) so that I can use existing observability infrastructure

### As a Developer
- I want request tracing and debugging information so that I can troubleshoot issues in my application
- I want performance insights per model so that I can choose the best models for my use case
- I want API usage analytics so that I can understand my application's AI consumption patterns

### As a System Administrator
- I want automatic performance tuning so that the system optimizes itself for my workload
- I want resource utilization dashboards so that I can monitor system health
- I want trend analysis so that I can predict future resource needs
- I want configuration recommendations so that I can optimize performance without deep expertise

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- **Metrics Collection**: Comprehensive metrics for requests, responses, models, and system resources
- **Performance Tracking**: Detailed timing information for all operations
- **Usage Analytics**: Model popularity, request patterns, and user behavior analysis
- **Health Monitoring**: System health indicators and anomaly detection
- **Self-Optimization**: Automatic configuration tuning based on observed patterns
- **Export Integration**: Prometheus, JSON, and other standard formats

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **Low Overhead**: <2% performance impact from metrics collection
- **Real-time Updates**: Metrics updated within 1 second of events
- **Storage Efficiency**: Configurable retention and aggregation policies
- **Export Performance**: Metrics export completes within 100ms
- **Memory Usage**: <100MB additional memory for metrics storage
- **Constitutional Compliance**: Observability features respect all architectural constraints

## Success Criteria

### User Success
- **Actionable Insights**: Users can identify and resolve performance issues using provided metrics
- **Automatic Optimization**: System automatically improves performance for user workloads
- **Predictive Planning**: Users can plan capacity needs based on trend analysis

### Technical Success
- **Minimal Impact**: Observability adds <2% overhead to request processing
- **Rich Data**: 50+ relevant metrics covering all aspects of system operation
- **Integration Ready**: Works seamlessly with popular monitoring tools
- **Self-Improving**: System automatically tunes 5+ configuration parameters

## What We Are NOT Building
- **Complex Analytics Engine**: Avoid building a full analytics platform
- **Long-term Data Storage**: Focus on recent metrics, not historical data warehouse
- **Custom UI/Dashboard**: Integrate with existing tools rather than building custom interfaces
- **ML-based Optimization**: Keep optimization algorithms simple and predictable

## Core Metrics Categories

### Request Metrics
- Request count, latency, error rates
- Model-specific performance statistics
- Queue depth and processing times
- Cache hit/miss rates

### Resource Metrics
- CPU, memory, disk, and network utilization
- GPU usage and performance (when available)
- Model loading times and memory consumption
- Connection pool statistics

### Business Metrics
- Model popularity and usage patterns
- Cost-per-request estimates
- User behavior analytics
- Capacity utilization trends

### System Health
- Error rates and types
- Resource exhaustion warnings
- Performance degradation alerts
- Optimization recommendations

## Self-Optimization Capabilities
- **Automatic Memory Tuning**: Adjust cache sizes based on usage patterns
- **Model Preloading Optimization**: Learn which models to preload for best performance
- **Connection Pool Sizing**: Automatically size connection pools for optimal throughput
- **Response Timeout Adjustment**: Tune timeouts based on observed model performance
- **Resource Allocation**: Recommend optimal resource allocation based on workload

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] 50+ relevant metrics covering all system aspects
- [ ] Metrics collection adds <2% performance overhead
- [ ] Prometheus endpoint exports all metrics within 100ms
- [ ] Self-optimization improves performance by 10%+ for common workloads
- [ ] Health alerts trigger within 30 seconds of issues
- [ ] Memory usage for observability stays under 100MB
- [ ] Integration works with Grafana, Prometheus, and DataDog
- [ ] CLI provides human-readable metrics summary
- [ ] All metrics respect user privacy (no prompt content stored)
- [ ] Constitutional compliance maintained across all features

## Edge Cases & Error Conditions
- **High Load Scenarios**: Ensure metrics collection doesn't degrade under heavy load
- **Memory Pressure**: Gracefully reduce metrics detail when memory constrained
- **Export Failures**: Continue operating when external monitoring systems are unavailable
- **Clock Skew**: Handle time synchronization issues gracefully
- **Configuration Errors**: Provide clear guidance for observability setup issues

## Constitutional Compliance Check
- [x] **5MB Binary Limit**: Observability features designed to be lightweight
- [x] **Sub-2-Second Startup**: Metrics initialization is fast
- [x] **Zero Python Dependencies**: Pure Rust implementation for all observability features
- [x] **OpenAI API Compatibility**: Metrics collection is transparent to API usage
- [x] **Library-First**: Observability engine can be used as standalone component
- [x] **CLI Interface**: All observability features accessible via command line
- [x] **Test-First**: Comprehensive test coverage for all metrics and optimization features

## Privacy & Security Considerations
- **No Prompt Storage**: Never store user prompts or responses in metrics
- **Aggregated Data Only**: Store only aggregated statistics, not individual requests
- **Configurable Privacy**: Users can disable detailed tracking if needed
- **Secure Export**: Ensure metrics export doesn't leak sensitive information

## Integration with Existing Features
- **Model Preloading**: Optimize preloading decisions based on usage metrics
- **Response Caching**: Track cache performance and optimize cache policies
- **Request Routing**: Use performance metrics to improve routing decisions
- **GPU Backends**: Monitor GPU utilization and performance across backends
- **Integration Templates**: Include observability setup in deployment templates
