# Feature 003 â€” Integration Templates & Auto-Configuration

## Intent
Dramatically reduce deployment friction by providing one-command generation of complete integration templates for popular platforms, frameworks, and deployment scenarios, enabling developers to integrate Shimmy in minutes rather than hours.

## Problem Statement
Integrating AI inference into applications requires significant configuration overhead:
- Setting up Docker containers, Kubernetes deployments, and cloud platform configurations
- Writing integration code for different web frameworks (FastAPI, Express, etc.)
- Configuring monitoring, health checks, and production best practices
- Understanding Shimmy-specific configuration options and optimization settings

Developers waste hours on deployment boilerplate instead of focusing on their core application logic.

## User Stories

### As a Full-Stack Developer
- I want one-command deployment templates so that I can integrate Shimmy into my project in minutes
- I want framework-specific integration code so that I can use Shimmy with my preferred web framework
- I want production-ready configurations so that I don't have to learn DevOps best practices

### As a DevOps Engineer
- I want standardized deployment templates so that I can deploy Shimmy consistently across environments
- I want monitoring and health check configurations so that I can integrate with existing observability infrastructure
- I want security-conscious configurations so that deployments follow best practices by default

### As a Platform Engineer
- I want cloud-specific templates so that I can deploy on Railway, Fly.io, AWS, etc. with optimal configurations
- I want resource optimization templates so that deployments are cost-effective
- I want scaling configurations so that I can handle varying traffic loads

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- **Platform Templates**: Docker, Kubernetes, cloud platform configurations
- **Framework Integration**: FastAPI, Express.js, and other web framework wrappers
- **One-Command Generation**: Simple CLI commands to generate complete project templates
- **Production Readiness**: Include monitoring, health checks, logging, and security configurations
- **Customization Options**: Template parameters for project names, ports, resource limits

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **Template Generation Speed**: Templates generate within 1 second
- **File Size Efficiency**: Generated templates are minimal and focused
- **Documentation Quality**: Each template includes clear README and setup instructions
- **Platform Compatibility**: Templates work on major platforms (Linux, macOS, Windows)
- **Constitutional Compliance**: Template generation respects binary size and startup constraints

## Success Criteria

### User Success
- **Rapid Integration**: Developers can deploy Shimmy in under 5 minutes
- **Production Ready**: Generated templates include production best practices
- **Framework Flexibility**: Support for popular web frameworks out of the box

### Technical Success
- **Complete Templates**: Generated projects run without additional configuration
- **Best Practices**: Templates include monitoring, health checks, and security
- **Minimal Overhead**: Template generation adds <1MB to binary size
- **Documentation Quality**: Clear setup instructions for all platforms

## What We Are NOT Building
- **GUI Configuration**: Focus on CLI-driven template generation
- **Custom Platform Support**: Stick to major, popular platforms
- **Complex Orchestration**: Avoid building complex deployment orchestration
- **Framework-Specific Features**: Keep integrations minimal and focused

## Core Template Categories

### Container Platforms
- **Docker**: Multi-stage builds, Alpine runtime, security best practices
- **Kubernetes**: Deployments, services, ingress, resource limits
- **Docker Compose**: Multi-service development environments

### Cloud Platforms
- **Railway**: Optimized configurations for Railway deployment
- **Fly.io**: Edge deployment configurations
- **Generic Cloud**: Templates adaptable to AWS, GCP, Azure

### Web Framework Integration
- **FastAPI**: Python wrapper with OpenAI-compatible endpoints
- **Express.js**: Node.js wrapper with middleware and error handling
- **Generic HTTP**: Language-agnostic HTTP integration examples

### Development Tools
- **Dev Container**: VS Code development container configuration
- **GitHub Actions**: CI/CD pipeline templates
- **Local Development**: Docker Compose for local development

## Template Features

### Production Best Practices
- Health check endpoints and monitoring
- Structured logging and observability
- Resource limits and auto-scaling
- Security hardening and least privilege

### Customization Options
- Project name and port configuration
- Resource limit customization
- Environment-specific variables
- Optional feature toggles

### Documentation Quality
- Clear setup and deployment instructions
- Configuration explanation and tuning guides
- Troubleshooting and FAQ sections
- Integration examples and use cases

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Templates generate within 1 second via CLI commands
- [ ] Docker templates build and run without additional configuration
- [ ] Kubernetes templates deploy successfully with kubectl apply
- [ ] Framework integration templates provide working API endpoints
- [ ] All templates include comprehensive README documentation
- [ ] Generated projects include production monitoring and health checks
- [ ] Template customization works correctly for all parameters
- [ ] Constitutional compliance maintained across all templates
- [ ] Templates work on major platforms (Linux, macOS, Windows)

## Edge Cases & Error Conditions
- **Invalid Parameters**: Graceful handling of invalid template parameters
- **File System Conflicts**: Handle existing files and directory conflicts
- **Platform Differences**: Ensure templates work across different operating systems
- **Network Issues**: Templates work in air-gapped or restricted network environments

## Constitutional Compliance Check
- [x] **Lightweight Binary**: Template files embedded efficiently
- [x] **Sub-2-Second Startup**: Template generation doesn't impact startup
- [x] **Zero Python Dependencies**: Templates use appropriate language ecosystems
- [x] **OpenAI API Compatibility**: All integrations maintain API compatibility
- [x] **Library-First**: Template generation can be used as standalone component
- [x] **CLI Interface**: All template generation accessible via command line
- [x] **Test-First**: Generated templates include testing configurations

## Security Considerations
- **Least Privilege**: Templates follow security best practices
- **No Hardcoded Secrets**: Use environment variables for sensitive configuration
- **Container Security**: Docker templates use security-conscious configurations
- **Network Security**: Appropriate network policies and access controls

## Integration with Existing Features
- **Model Management**: Templates include model configuration best practices
- **Observability**: Templates integrate with monitoring and metrics collection
- **Configuration**: Templates demonstrate optimal Shimmy configuration
- **Performance**: Templates include performance optimization settings
