=======
**Wrong**: "First Working Implementation", "Revolutionary breakthrough"  
>>>>>>> main
**Right**: "Rust bindings for existing llama.cpp functionality (PR #15077, Aug 4, 2025)"

**Evidence**:
- llama.cpp added `--cpu-moe` on August 4, 2025 (PR #15077 by @slaren)
- We started work October 4, 2025 (2 months AFTER upstream)
- Our contribution: Rust bindings + shimmy integration, NOT the core algorithm

### 2. **MEMORY USAGE CONTRADICTIONS** ❌
<<<<<<< HEAD
<<<<<<< HEAD
**Wrong**: Executive summary claims "2MB VRAM" but table shows "2.33GB" and logs show "~1.8GB"
=======
**Wrong**: Executive summary claims "2MB VRAM" but table shows "2.33GB" and logs show "~1.8GB"  
>>>>>>> main
=======
**Wrong**: Executive summary claims "2MB VRAM" but table shows "2.33GB" and logs show "~1.8GB"  
>>>>>>> main
**Right**: Report measured range (1.8-2.3GB) and quarantine unreproducible 2MB claim

**Contradictions in original whitepaper**:
```
Line 11: "2MB GPU memory" (Executive Summary)
Line 45: "2.33GB VRAM" (Table)
Line 572: "≈1818 MiB" (Live logs)
```

### 3. **NO REAL BASELINES** ❌
<<<<<<< HEAD
<<<<<<< HEAD
**Wrong**: All "baseline" numbers marked *estimated*
=======
**Wrong**: All "baseline" numbers marked *estimated*  
>>>>>>> main
=======
**Wrong**: All "baseline" numbers marked *estimated*  
>>>>>>> main
**Right**: Need controlled A/B runs (with/without `--cpu-moe`) on same hardware

**Every baseline in original paper**: "~15GB*" with asterisk noting "Estimated based on model size"

### 4. **TOKEN COUNTING BROKEN** ❌
<<<<<<< HEAD
<<<<<<< HEAD
**Wrong**:
=======
**Wrong**: 
>>>>>>> main
=======
**Wrong**: 
>>>>>>> main
- Non-streaming: word_count × 1.3 (not valid)
- Streaming: SSE chunk count (chunks ≠ tokens)

**Right**: Use model tokenizer to count actual tokens

**From original methodology**:
```bash
WORD_COUNT=$(echo "$RESPONSE_TEXT" | wc -w)
ESTIMATED_TOKENS=$(echo "$WORD_COUNT * 1.3" | bc)  # ← NOT VALID
```

### 5. **TTFT IS GUESSED** ❌
<<<<<<< HEAD
<<<<<<< HEAD
**Wrong**: "TTFT estimation: 10% of total time" (literally made up)
=======
**Wrong**: "TTFT estimation: 10% of total time" (literally made up)  
>>>>>>> main
=======
**Wrong**: "TTFT estimation: 10% of total time" (literally made up)  
>>>>>>> main
**Right**: Per-token timestamp logging required

**From original methodology**:
```bash
# TTFT estimation: 10% of total time (first token typically arrives quickly)
# Note: True TTFT requires per-token timestamp logging (not implemented in current setup)
```

### 6. **SINGLE-RUN MEASUREMENTS** ❌
<<<<<<< HEAD
<<<<<<< HEAD
**Wrong**: N=1 for all tests (no statistical validity)
**Right**: N≥3 with mean ± σ

### 7. **MISSING TECHNICAL DETAILS** ❌
**Wrong**: No SHA256s, no exact commits, no controlled experiments

## What We Actually Did (Accurate Attribution)

### Timeline
```
Aug 4, 2025:  llama.cpp PR #15077 merged (--cpu-moe, --n-cpu-moe)
              By @slaren
              https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp/pull/15077

Oct 4, 2025:  We started work on Rust bindings
              Commit 038fa4b: "WIP: Add MoE CPU offloading support (TESTING)"

Oct 6, 2025:  Updated llama.cpp from b6482 to b6686 (already had MoE support)
              Commit 6c9a704: "Update llama.cpp to b6686 for proper MoE support"

Oct 6-8:      Testing, benchmarking, documentation
```

### Our Actual Contribution
✅ **Rust bindings** for llama.cpp's MoE offloading:
```rust
// llama-cpp-2/src/model/params.rs
pub fn with_cpu_moe_all(mut self) -> Self { ... }
pub fn with_n_cpu_moe(mut self, n: usize) -> Self { ... }
```

✅ **Shimmy CLI integration**:
```bash
shimmy serve --cpu-moe              # Maps to with_cpu_moe_all()
shimmy serve --n-cpu-moe 10         # Maps to with_n_cpu_moe(10)
```

✅ **Comprehensive testing**:
- 3 model families (GPT-OSS, Phi-3.5-MoE, DeepSeek)
- Streaming vs non-streaming benchmarks
- Quality validation
- HuggingFace model cards

❌ **NOT our contribution**:
- Core MoE offloading algorithm (llama.cpp)
- Tensor buffer override mechanism (llama.cpp)
- Expert tensor detection (llama.cpp)

**New Subtitle**: "Production Integration of llama.cpp MoE Expert Tensor Offloading in Rust"

#### 2. Accurate Executive Summary
**Old**:
```markdown
### Key Achievements
- **99.9% VRAM Reduction**: GPT-OSS 20B running with 2MB vs 15GB GPU memory
- **First Working Implementation**: CPU offloading for MoE expert tensors
```

**New**:
```markdown
### What We Built
- **Rust bindings** for llama.cpp's MoE CPU offloading (methods: with_cpu_moe_all(), with_n_cpu_moe(n))
- **CLI integration** in Shimmy: --cpu-moe and --n-cpu-moe N flags
- **Validation** across three MoE model families (20B-42B parameters)

### Measured Results (NVIDIA GH200 480GB)
- **GPT-OSS 20B**: ~1.8-2.3GB VRAM with --cpu-moe vs ~15GB estimated baseline
```

#### 3. Upfront Disclosure
**Added immediately after title**:
```markdown

(llama-cpp-2 crate) and **production integration** in Shimmy with comprehensive testing.
```

#### 4. Known Limitations Section
**Added comprehensive limitations**:
```markdown
### Known Limitations
- **No controlled baselines**: Baseline numbers are estimates from model size, not measured A/B comparisons
- **Token counting inaccurate**: Current measurements use word_count × 1.3 (non-streaming) or SSE chunk counting (streaming)
- **TTFT estimated**: First token latency derived from 10% heuristic, not per-token timestamps
- **Single-run measurements**: No statistical variance (N=1 for all tests)
- **Historical 2MB claim unreproducible**: Earlier builds showed ~2MB VRAM; current builds measure 1.8-2.3GB
```

#### 5. Upstream Attribution Section
**Added full credit**:
```markdown
### llama.cpp MoE Offloading
- **Original Implementation**: PR #15077 by @slaren (https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp/pull/15077)
- **Merged**: August 4, 2025
- **Flags**: --cpu-moe, --n-cpu-moe N
- **Mechanism**: tensor_buft_overrides with regex pattern matching

### Our Contribution
- **Rust Bindings**: llama-cpp-2 crate methods with_cpu_moe_all(), with_n_cpu_moe(n)
- **Shimmy Integration**: CLI flags, configuration plumbing, testing framework
- **Validation**: Cross-model testing, documentation, HuggingFace model cards
- **Not Novel**: The core MoE offloading algorithm was already in llama.cpp
```

#### 6. Discrepancy Investigation
**Added transparent disclosure**:
```markdown
### Discrepancy Investigation: 2MB vs 1.8GB
<<<<<<< HEAD
<<<<<<< HEAD
**Historical Claim**: Earlier builds (Oct 6) showed ~2MB VRAM usage
**Current Measurement**: Oct 7-8 builds show 1.8-2.3GB VRAM usage
**Status**: Under investigation. Until reproduced, we report **measured range of 1.8-2.3GB**

## Recommendations for Future Work

### Immediate Actions (High Priority)
1. **Run controlled A/B baselines**
   - Same hardware, same commit, with/without `--cpu-moe`
   - N=3 runs minimum
   - Report mean ± σ

2. **Fix token counting**
   - Use model tokenizer (not word count heuristic)
   - Emit per-token timestamps for precise TTFT/TPS

3. **Add SHA256 checksums**
   - All model files (input SafeTensors + output GGUF)
   - Add to reproduction table

4. **Reproduce or remove 2MB claim**
   - If reproducible: document exact flags/build
   - If not: remove from all documentation

### Medium Priority
5. **Add objective quality metrics**
   - Embedding similarity (cosine) for 20 prompts
   - Pass@k for code generation
   - Edit distance for deterministic outputs

6. **Create performance plots**
   - VRAM (baseline vs offload) per model
   - TTFT per model
   - TPS vs prompt length

7. **Document memory profiling**
   - cudaMemGetInfo() deltas
   - CPU pinning semantics (page-locked host memory)

### Low Priority
8. **Statistical rigor**
   - N≥3 for all benchmarks
   - Confidence intervals
   - Variance analysis

9. **Extended validation**
   - More model families
   - Different hardware (A100, H100, consumer GPUs)
   - Different GGUF quantizations (Q4, Q5, Q8)

## User Guidance Impact

### Before (Misleading)
```markdown
### Key Achievements
- **99.9% VRAM Reduction**: GPT-OSS 20B running with 2MB vs 15GB GPU memory
- **First Working Implementation**: CPU offloading for MoE expert tensors
```
**Problem**: Users expect 2MB VRAM, get 1.8-2.3GB → loss of trust

### After (Honest)
```markdown
### Measured Results (NVIDIA GH200 480GB)
- **GPT-OSS 20B**: ~1.8-2.3GB VRAM with --cpu-moe vs ~15GB estimated baseline
- **Phi-3.5-MoE 42B**: ~2.8GB VRAM with --cpu-moe vs ~80GB estimated baseline

### Known Limitations
- No controlled baselines (estimates only)
- Token counting inaccurate
- Single-run measurements (N=1)
```
**Benefit**: Users have accurate expectations, trust the data

## File Structure

### Original (Problematic)
```
docs/MOE-CPU-OFFLOADING-WHITEPAPER.md  ← Marketing material with overclaims
```

### New (Corrected)
```
docs/MOE-TECHNICAL-VALIDATION.md        ← Honest technical validation
docs/MOE-WHITEPAPER-CORRECTIONS.md      ← This file (audit summary)
docs/MOE-CPU-OFFLOADING-WHITEPAPER.md   ← Keep for historical record
```

### Recommendation
- **Primary document**: MOE-TECHNICAL-VALIDATION.md (link from README)
- **Archive**: MOE-CPU-OFFLOADING-WHITEPAPER.md (historical, marked deprecated)
- **Transparency**: MOE-WHITEPAPER-CORRECTIONS.md (shows what changed and why)

## Conclusion

### What We Got Wrong
1. Claimed "first implementation" when llama.cpp did it 2 months earlier
2. Led with unreproducible 2MB claim instead of measured 1.8-2.3GB
3. Used estimates instead of controlled baselines
4. Made up token counts and TTFT measurements
5. Presented single runs as reliable data (N=1)

### What We Got Right
1. Successfully created Rust bindings for llama.cpp MoE offloading
2. Integrated into Shimmy with working CLI flags
3. Validated across 3 diverse model families
4. Created comprehensive HuggingFace model cards
5. Preserved raw evidence logs

### What We Fixed
1. Honest positioning: "Rust bindings" not "first implementation"
2. Accurate measurements: 1.8-2.3GB range, not 2MB
3. Upfront limitations: No baselines, inaccurate counting, single runs
4. Full attribution: llama.cpp PR #15077 credited
5. Transparent disclosures: Known issues documented
