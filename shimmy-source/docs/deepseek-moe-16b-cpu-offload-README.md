# Initialize model with CPU expert offloading
llm = Llama(
    model_path="./models/deepseek-moe-16b-f16.gguf",
    n_ctx=4096,
    cpu_moe=True,  # Enable CPU expert offloading
    verbose=True
)

# Generate text
response = llm("What is mixture of experts in AI?", max_tokens=100)
print(response['choices'][0]['text'])
```
