- [ ] **Success criteria are measurable** (specific targets defined)
- [ ] **Scope is clearly bounded** (what's included/excluded)
- [ ] **Constitutional compliance verified** (meets all architectural principles)
- [ ] **Integration impact assessed** (effects on existing functionality)
- [ ] **Error conditions considered** (failure modes identified)
- [ ] **All ambiguities marked** (NEEDS CLARIFICATION items noted)
