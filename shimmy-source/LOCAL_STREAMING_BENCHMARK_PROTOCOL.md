## Test Execution Framework

### Per-Model Test Protocol

For each model (DeepSeek → GPT-OSS → Phi-3.5-MoE):

1. **Model Loading**:
   - Clean start shimmy server with `--cpu-moe`
   - Record load time and memory distribution
   - Verify expert tensor CPU offloading

2. **Systematic Testing**:
   - Execute all 9 benchmark tests in order
   - Allow 5-second pause between tests
   - Record all metrics for each test

3. **Quality Assessment**:
   - Manual review of all generated content
   - Flag any repetition or quality issues
   - Document edge cases or failures

4. **Resource Monitoring**:
   - Continuous memory monitoring during tests
   - Performance profiling for bottlenecks
   - Temperature validation throughout

### White Paper Data Collection

For each model, document:

#### Architecture Specifications
- Parameter count
- Expert configuration (count, active per token)
- Context length
- Model file size

#### Memory Performance
- Baseline GPU memory (estimated)
- CPU offloaded GPU memory (measured)
- VRAM savings percentage
- Memory distribution breakdown

#### Streaming Performance
- Average tokens/second across all tests
- Range of performance (min/max)
- First token latency average
- Streaming responsiveness rating

#### Quality Validation
- Repetition score across all tests
- Content quality assessment
- Technical accuracy rate
- Completion success rate

## Expected Outcomes

Based on H100 results, local hardware expectations:

### Memory Savings (Should Match H100)
- **DeepSeek 16B**: ~95-99% VRAM savings

=======
- **GPT-OSS 20B**: ~99% VRAM savings  
>>>>>>> main
- **Phi-3.5-MoE 41.9B**: ~97% VRAM savings

### Performance (Expected Lower Than H100)
- **H100 baseline**: Not documented in whitepaper
- **Local expectation**: 1-3 tokens/second based on initial testing
- **Streaming UX**: Should feel responsive despite lower speed

### Quality (Should Match H100)
- **Temperature 0.3**: No repetition issues
- **Content quality**: Maintained across all models
- **Technical accuracy**: Preserved with CPU offloading
